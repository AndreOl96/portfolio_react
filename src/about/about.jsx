        <p>Hello, I'm Andre Oliveira and I'm a designer passionate about creating beautiful visual experiences. Recently, I embarked on the exciting journey of fullstack development to expand my skills and create even more amazing projects.</p>
      <p>With a strong background in design and growing experience in web development, I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate on challenging and innovative projects that allow me to continue learning and growing professionally.</p>
      <p>I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities, so feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss a project or just say hello!</p>
      <p>In addition to design and development, I'm also passionate about photography and visual experiences, but what I enjoy most is programming. In my free time, you can find me taking long walks in nature, listening to music, or most likely riding a motorcycle.</p>
